# Introduction

## Repository contents

This repository holds sample data for apartments scraped for imoti.bg. The idea is to build a data engineering pipeline
which takes the raw data, cleans it, transforms it, and eventually stores it in a persistent location.

## Plan

1. Create self-container transformation steps.
2. Organize the transformations into a data pipeline using Kedro
3. Store and visualize using some BI software (Metabase? PowerBI?)

## How to run
